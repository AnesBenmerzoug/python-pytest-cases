  "description": "`pytest-cases` is a Python package leveraging the widely popular `pytest` library to design tests and benchmarks where test data, tested code, and evaluation protocols are strictly separated. The API for `pytest-cases` is as minimal as possible, so that each concept (test data, algorithms candidates, evaluation protocols) is a readable python function ; this is in line with the design philosophy of `pytest` itself.",
